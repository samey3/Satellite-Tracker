# Satellite-Tracker
 An Arduino-based device that predicts satellite passes over a user's location

 # To-Do
 * Get a finished physical design (updated casing, notification alarm?, updated PCB if needed)
 * Upload images of the device
 * Finish the release version of the software (with integrated OTA updating)
 * Improve the prediction program (e.g. minimum duration for passes?)
 * Provide a cleaned-up version of the updater program
 * Create a user guide on how to use it
 * Create a user-friendly web-page interface for finding a new satellite to track (and perhaps display additional info on it)
 * Create a small list of specifications if needed (e.g. power requirements, interface connections)

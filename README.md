# Satellite-Tracker
 An Arduino-based device that predicts satellite passes over a user's location

 # To-Do
 * Get a finished physical design (updated casing, notification alarm?, updated PCB if needed) (**Ditching the Arduino board entirely, will create a small PCB with the bare-essentials**)
 * Upload images of the device
 * ~~Finish the release version of the software (with integrated OTA updating)~~ Completed
 * Improve the prediction program (e.g. minimum duration for passes?)
 * ~~Provide a cleaned-up version of the updater program~~ In process of moving to a web-interface that may support multiple different types of devices.
 * Create a user guide on how to use it
 * Create a user-friendly web-page interface for finding a new satellite to track (**In progress**)
 * Create a small list of specifications if needed (e.g. power requirements, interface connections)
